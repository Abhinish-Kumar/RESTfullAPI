  ### REST - What you didn't know.

  ####  A brief history of REST

-Back in 1999, there was a lot of excitement about something called REST, which stands for Representational State Transfer. It all started when a group of experts, including a guy named Roy Fielding, shared some important guidelines for how computers should talk to each other over the internet. They wrote these guidelines in a document called RFC 2616, which focused on a way of communicating called HTTP (the same thing you see in web addresses).

Roy Fielding then took these ideas and created a set of rules to make web communication simpler and more efficient. This became known as REST. REST uses standard web methods like GET, POST, and PUT, and it relies on URLs (web addresses) to access and manage resources, like web pages or data on the internet.

REST made it easier for different computer systems to talk to each other in a straightforward, consistent way, making the web more powerful and flexible.
